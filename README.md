# DataModelforBank
Creating counterfeit note determination model for bank client


<Objective>
Build up predictive model to identify counterfeit notes for bank.

<Tasks>
Describe raw dataset(=sample) using univariate/bivariate analysis.
PCA(principal component analysis) on sample to identify the correlation between .
variables in the sample as well as its characteristics. This task will give the answer to the genuine/counterfeit nature of the note.
Apply classification algorithm.
